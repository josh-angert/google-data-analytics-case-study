# Google Data Analytics Case Study: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis



### 1. Introduction 
The scenario for this Case Study is as follows: I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the marketing team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

### 2. Business Task
The Director of Marketing has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. 

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The Director of Marketing has assigned me with the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
